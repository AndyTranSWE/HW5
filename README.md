Implemented Features:

1.) Random selection of letters for the Scrabble rack
seem to be fully working, and I can find no evidence to the contrary.
2.) All letter tiles can be dragged and dropped to the board, and
this seems to be fully working.
3.) Program succeeds at identifying the letters dropped to the 1-line
board and knowing what scores to reference based on the JSON file.
This seems fully implemented.
4.) Bonus squares are fully implemented.
5.) The score is tallied correctly, with the letter doubling
taking precedent over the word doubling, which seems correct. This
feature is fully implemented.
6.) Infinite play until the player quits seems to be fully implemented,
but I am not totally confident. It takes very long to test.
7.) The board is cleared when there is a new game. This is fully
implemented.
8.) After playing a word, the number of tiles added to the rack
is the minimum to return the rack to 7 tiles. This is fully
implemented.
9.) Score keeping for multiple words is fully implemented.
10.) Tiles are only droppable on the scrabble line-board
itself, and either float or snap back to the rack. This
sometimes causes the order of the tiles to change on the rack,
and I do not know if this is optimal. I will say this is
fully implemented, but not conventionally.
11.) Fully implemented tile freezing when on the board.
12.) All leters bounce back to the rack unless they are placed directly
next to a previously placed letter. This is fully implemented.
13.) Game restarts with the button "New Game" are fully implemented.

I did not do any extra credit features.
